//In a cinema hall, the chairs are arranged in a rectangular shape with r-rows and c-columns.
//There are three types of screenings with tickets at different prices:
//  V •	Premiere – premiere screening, at a price of 12.00 leva.
//  V •	Normal – standard screening, at a price of 7.50 leva.
//  V •	Discount – screening for children and students at a reduced price of 5.00 leva.


//Write a program that reads the type of screening (string),

//the number of
//rows and the number of
//columns in the hall (integers) entered by the user,
//and calculates the total ticket revenue at a full hall.
//The result should be presented in a format similar to the examples provided, showing 2 decimal places.  
//Example Input/Output
//To ensure the result is displayed with precisely two decimal places,
//use the following syntax: Console.WriteLine("{0:f2} leva", income).
