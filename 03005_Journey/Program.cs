//Input
//The input is read from the console - two lines, provided by the user:
//  V •	First line - Budget, floating point number in the range [10.00...5000.00].
//  V •	Second line - One of two possible seasons:  "summer" or "winter"

//Oddly, many individuals tend to plan their vacations well in advance.
//A young programmer, for instance, possesses a specific budget and a certain amount of free time during a particular season.
//Your task is to create a program that takes the budget and the season as inputs from the console,
//and produces an output detailing where the programmer will relax and how much he will spend.

//The budget determines the choice of destination,
//The season impacts how much of the budget will be spent.
//In the summer
// • Camping 
//In the winter
// • Hotel stay.

//However, if the destination is in Europe, a hotel stay will be selected no matter of the season.

//Each camping site or hotel has a price associated with it, which corresponds to a specific percentage of the budget: 

//•	If the budget is 100 leva or less - the destination will be somewhere in Bulgaria
//  •	Summer - 30% of the budget
//  •	Winter - 70% of the budget

//•	If the budget is 1 000 leva or less - the destination will be somewhere in the Balkans
//  •	Summer - 40% of the budget
//  •	Winter - 80% of the budget

//•	More than 1 000 leva - somewhere in Europe
//  •	When traveling around Europe, regardless of the season,
//  •   Spend  - 90% of the budget.

//Output
//Two lines must be printed as an output, on the console.

//•	First line - "Somewhere in {destination}" among "Bulgaria", "Balkans" and "Europe"
//•	Second line - "{holidayType} - {amountSpent}"
//•	Holidays can be between "Camp" and "Hotel"
//•	The amount must be rounded to the second decimal place.
