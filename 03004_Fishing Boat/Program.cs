//You will have to read three values from the Console:
//Input
//   V •	Group Budget - integer in the range [1... 8000]
//   V •	Season - string: "Spring", "Summer", "Autumn", "Winter"
//   V •	Fishermen Count - integer in the range [4... 18]
//   V •	If the group is up to 6 people including – a discount of 10%.
//   V •	If the group is from 7 to 11 people – a discount of 15%.
//   V •	If the group is from 12 people and more – a discount of 25%. 
//   V •	The price for renting the boat in the spring is 3000 BGN.
//   V •	The price for renting the boat in the summer and autumn is 4200 BGN.
//   V •	The price for renting the boat in winter is 2600 BGN.
//   V •    Furthermore, the fishermen receive an extra 5% discount if the total count of fishermen is even.

//This additional discount is applied after deducting the discounts mentioned above, except during the autumn season.
//In autumn, this extra discount does not apply.

//Write a program to calculate whether the fishermen will be able to gather enough money for the fishing trip. 

//Output
//The result should be printed on the Console on a single line:
//•	If the budget is sufficient:
//"Yes! You have {moneyLeft} leva left."
//•	If the budget is not enough:
//"Not enough money! You need {moreMoney} leva."
//The value of the currency must be formatted to the second decimal place.

//Tony and his friends were passionate about fishing.
//They were so enthusiastic about it that they opted to go fishing by boat.
//The rental cost of the boat depends on both the season and the number of fishermen.
