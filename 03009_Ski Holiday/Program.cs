//Atanas decided to spend his vacation in Bansko and go skiing. Before he goes, however, he must book a hotel
//and calculate how much his stay will cost.
//The following types of accommodation are available, each with its corresponding prices for stay:
//	"room for one person" - 118.00 BGN per night
//	"apartment" - 155.00 BGN per night 
//	"President Apartment" – 235.00 BGN per night
//Based on the number of days he plans to stay in the hotel (example: 11 days = 10 nights) and the type of room he chooses, he may be eligible for various discounts. 
//The available reductions are as follows:
//type of room        | Less than 10 days	| between 10 and 15 days inclusive | 	more than 15 days  |
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//room for one person | 0 Discount          | 0 discount                       | 0 Discount            |
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//apartment	          | 30% of the price   |	35% of the price	           | 50% of the final price|
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//president apartment |	10% of the price   | 15% of the price                  |	20% of the price   |
//After the stay, Atanas' assessment of the hotel's services can be positive or negative.  If his assessment is "positive", Atanas adds 25% of it to the price with the already deducted discount. If his assessment is "negative", he deducts 10% from the price.
